# ScoresOfScores

The ['Scores of Scores'](https://fourscoreandmore.org/scores-of-scores/) lieder corpus encoding project is a major contribution to the [OpenScore](https://openscore.cc/) encoding effort: creating and releasing publicly a large repository of high-quality musical scores which any internet user will be able to download and use as they please.

This is a corpus of French and German songs from the 19th century. We inherited a corpus of vocal lines from Leigh Van Handel et al. whose corpus of [French songs is here](https://github.com/leighvh1/19th-century-art-songs-by-French-composers), and the [German songs is here](https://github.com/leighvh1/19th-century-art-songs-by-German-composers). This project involved converted those files and crowd-sourcing completions of the piano piano parts. A full explanation of the project is provided [here](https://fourscoreandmore.org/scores-of-scores/)
