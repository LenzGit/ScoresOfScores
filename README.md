The [Scores of Scores] lieder corpus encoding project is a major contribution to the [OpenScore] encoding effort: creating and releasing publicly a large repository of high-quality musical scores which any internet user will be able to download and use as they please.

[OpenScore]: https://openscore.cc/ "OpenScore - liberating sheet music"

This is a corpus of French and German songs from the 19th century. We inherited a corpus of vocal lines from Leigh Van Handel et al. whose corpus of [French songs is here][LvH French], and [German songs is here][LvH German]. This project involved converted those files and crowd-sourcing completions of the piano piano parts. A full explanation of the project is provided [here][Scores of Scores].
